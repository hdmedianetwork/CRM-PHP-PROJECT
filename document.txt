  - Allow top-tier franchises to create sub-franchises with the same model.
  
- **Wallet Management:**
  - Recharge franchise wallets manually.
  - View wallet transaction history.
  - Define test pricing for B2B (franchise pricing) and B2C (patient pricing).
  
- **Test Management:**
  - Create and update test catalog.
  - Define B2B and B2C pricing for each test.
  
- **Revenue Management:**
  - Track revenue generated by each franchise.
  - Automatically calculate and deduct the admin’s share from the franchise's revenue.

- **Reports:**
  - Generate reports on franchise performance, revenue, and wallet balances.
