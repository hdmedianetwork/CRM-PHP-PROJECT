### **Project Name:**  
Health Test Lab Management System with Franchise Model

### **Objective:**  
To create a streamlined system that allows health test labs to manage patient testing, report generation, franchise operations, and revenue sharing under a tiered franchise model.

## **System Features**

### **1. Admin Module**
- **Franchise Management:**
  - Create franchise accounts (Gold, Diamond, etc.).
  - Assign login credentials (no self-signup for franchises).
  - Define revenue-sharing percentages (0%, 20%, 50%, 80%) based on the franchise category.
  - Allow top-tier franchises to create sub-franchises with the same model.
  
- **Wallet Management:**
  - Recharge franchise wallets manually.
  - View wallet transaction history.
  - Define test pricing for B2B (franchise pricing) and B2C (patient pricing).
  
- **Test Management:**
  - Create and update test catalog.
  - Define B2B and B2C pricing for each test.
  
- **Revenue Management:**
  - Track revenue generated by each franchise.
  - Automatically calculate and deduct the admin’s share from the franchise's revenue.

- **Reports:**
  - Generate reports on franchise performance, revenue, and wallet balances.
  - Track patient test records and invoices.
